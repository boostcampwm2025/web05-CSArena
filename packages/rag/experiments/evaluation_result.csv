This is also sometimes called the _data rate._ We might say that\nthe bandwidth of an Ethernet link is 10 Mbps. A useful distinction can also be made, however, between\nthe maximum data rate that is available on the link and the number of bits per second that we can actually\ntransmit over the link in practice. We tend to use the word _throughput_ to refer to the _measured performance_\nof a system. Thus, because of various inefficiencies of implementation, a pair of nodes connected by a\nlink with a bandwidth of 10 Mbps might achieve a throughput of only 2 Mbps. This would mean that an\napplication on one host could send data to the other host at 2 Mbps.  \n\nFinally, we often talk about the bandwidth _requirements_ of an application. This is the number of bits per\nsecond that it needs to transmit over the network to perform acceptably. For some applications, this might\nbe “whatever I can get”; for others, it might be some fixed number (preferably not more than the available\nlink bandwidth); and for others, it might be a number that varies with time. We will provide more on this\ntopic later in this section.']","대역폭은 네트워크 링크가 초당 전송할 수 있는 비트 수를 의미하며, 처리량은 실제로 측정된 시스템의 성능을 나타낸다. 예를 들어, 10 Mbps 대역폭을 가진 이더넷 링크가 구현상의 비효율성으로 인해 실제 처리량이 2 Mbps일 수 있다.","대역폭은 네트워크 링크가 초당 전송할 수 있는 비트 수를 의미하며, 처리량은 실제로 측정된 시스템의 성능을 나타낸다. 예를 들어, 10 Mbps 대역폭을 가진 이더넷 링크가 구현상의 비효율성으로 인해 실제 처리량이 2 Mbps일 수 있다.",1.0,0.9887623774129142,0.99999999995
아래 중 블루투스와 와이파이의 데이터 전송 속도에 관한 설명으로 올바른 것은?,"['There is a baffling assortment of different wireless technologies, each of which makes different tradeoffs\nin various dimensions. One simple way to categorize the different technologies is by the data rates they\nprovide and how far apart communicating nodes can be. Other important differences include which part of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum they use (including whether it requires a license) and how much power they\nconsume. In this section, we discuss two prominent wireless technologies: Wi-Fi (more formally known as\n802.11), and Bluetooth. The next section discusses cellular networks in the context of ISP access services.\n\nTable 2.3 gives an overview of these technologies and how they compare to each other.  \n\nTable 2.3.: Overview of Leading Wireless Technologies.  \n|Col1|Bluetooth (802.15.1)|Wi-Fi (802.11)|4G Cellular|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Typical link length|10 m|100 m|Tens of kilometers|\n|Typical data rate|2 Mbps (shared)|150-450 Mbps|1-5 Mbps|\n|Typical use|Link a peripheral to a<br>computer|Link a computer to a<br>wired base|Link mobile phone to a<br>wired tower|\n|Wired<br>technology<br>analogy|USB|Ethernet|PON|  \nYou may recall that bandwidth sometimes means the width of a frequency band in hertz and sometimes the\ndata rate of a link. Because both these concepts come up in discussions of wireless networks, we’re going to\nuse _bandwidth_ here in its stricter sense—width of a frequency band—and use the term _data rate_ to describe\nthe number of bits per second that can be sent over the link, as in Table 2.3.']",블루투스는 2 Mbps이고 와이파이는 150-450 Mbps이다.,블루투스는 2 Mbps이고 와이파이는 150-450 Mbps이다.,1.0,0.9905954068349846,0.9999999999
고속 네트워크에서 단일 RTT 동안 더 많은 데이터를 전송할 수 있기 때문에 중요한 설계 고려 사항이 되는 것은 무엇인가?,"['Figure 1.19.: Relationship between bandwidth and latency. A 1-MB file would fill the 1-Mbps link 80 times\nbut only fill 1/12th of a 1-Gbps link.  \n\nAnother way to think about the situation is that more data can be transmitted during each RTT on a highspeed network, so much so that a single RTT becomes a significant amount of time. Thus, while you\nwouldn’t think twice about the difference between a file transfer taking 101 RTTs rather than 100 RTTs (a\nrelative difference of only 1%), suddenly the difference between 1 RTT and 2 RTTs is significant—a 100%\nincrease. In other words, latency, rather than throughput, starts to dominate our thinking about network\ndesign.  \n\nPerhaps the best way to understand the relationship between throughput and latency is to return to basics.  \nThe effective end-to-end throughput that can be achieved over a network is given by the simple relationship  \n\nThroughput = TransferSize / TransferTime  \nwhere TransferTime includes not only the elements of one-way identified earlier in this section, but also any\nadditional time spent requesting or setting up the transfer.
